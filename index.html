im so bored running into the door 
its all in my head
it doesnt live here anymore
im so bored 
i need a friend i need a sword
go in wishing wells
i send my body to explore 

i want more nicotine 
hurricane, sunrise 
brown eyes, certified 
digging in the soft dirt 
blue eyes, certified 
digging under water 
i don't want to know my future

i dont want to  know my

walking back to donut shopping loving this time.
i just want two belly two
at the window drawing hearts
at the window

quarter inch cable in my bed
 ill move it when i'm dead 
turned into a snake and 
wrapped around my neck 
offline i forget 
the timeline is different

draw clear hearts raining on the window
dreaming cloud gripping tight the chance of

when u smile at your computer screen 
i cant think about anything

<h1>snowman core</h1>

this is the joke we tell
this is a laughing tear
this is not a date so not a date
i just frown

looking out the door
breathing hot
breathing on your hair
breathing on your hair
breathing waking up

arent you full
just like that
arent you full

just when thats enough 
shitty how you want to get so floored 
where is everything that i adore
cassette player hidden 
closet door 
it all sounds breathing
i like to find the new seedling
and bring them into my home 
just like you always would do

dressing like a clown
burning cheeks you shout and turn the door
it is everything that i - 

closet door
running like a fridge
the pressure and i know that there is 
so much courage
in the hiding person

this is the only way
we catch the falling tear
theres no time for dates forever days
i just frown 

laughing through the door
way too hot
melting on your hair
melting on your hair
way too hot

tell me where it hurts 
u arent even trying 
think you kind of like it
miserable, falling and dying
late to every outing 
you love to hate it 
you hate loving me 

just when that's enough 
shitty how you want to get so floored 
where is everything that i adore
cassette player hidden 
closet door 
it all sounds breathing
i like to find the new seedling
and bring them into my home 
just like you always would do

breathing heart
no angels
its always simple
breathing heart
no angels
laughing always simple
it’s always simple
laughing through the door
its so simple

<h1>floppy hats for girls</h1>

deadbeat mediocre skater 
wanting to be something more
im a heartbreaker knockin 
til you let me in your door 
my house is just a body 
no you can't live with me here
(unintelligible)

bow on a boy 
don't just sit there in the road 
skip the locker room
i dont have a change of clothes
sometimes its so sticky i cant let go 
patience kid
what do u know 
patience kid 
what do u know 

put a bow on a boy dont just 
give up and go 
what do you know 
you're wasting your energy 

i know it’s too fluffy
dont think the flowers didnt come up
dont think

cant lock the door
we drink the juice
and mop the floor
so beaten
and still we feel un-

touch it touch it 
bleed it need to 
make it want to be it 
check my pulse 
i think i'm dying 
sweetest air is what 
ur sighing when we’re kissing in the dark 
this ain't a restart 
no bleeding heart
no fine art shopping cart 

put a bow on a boy 
don't just sit there in the road 
skip the locker room 
i don't have a change of clothes
sometimes it's so sticky i can't let go 
patience kid what do u know 
patience kid what do u know 

dont stop playing
saw what didn’t happen 
shut the body yeah
shut the body yeah
dont stop playing
saw what didn’t happen 
shut the body yeah
shut the body yeah	

<h1>ur bpm</h1>

static in the night 
when i'm sleeping on the ice
u can smell it right
dusk in ur eye ball

static in the night 
dial leaking blinding light 
buzzing from the fight 
ringing in my mind now 

static in the night 
taking solace in the height
tired poltergeist
running towards the light house
 
if u touch me again
i will bite off ur hand 
if you touch me again 
if you lay one 

youre the shadow of a man 
that you want to be again 
if u touch me again 
if u lay 1 hand on me ill make u fear me
 
starts in 
the car with the car wet window
pass around 
pass around
building the heaven with the stones forever
forever forever


ive been putting you first 
for too long for too long 
ive been trying not to ruin your whole life but you’ve got no problem fucking up mine 

if u touch me again
i will bite off your hand 
if u touch me again if u lay 1  
ur the shadow of a man
that u want to  be again 
i will bite off ur hand if you lay 1 hand
on me ill make u fear me

starts in 
car wet window
pass it 
pass around
building stones forever
holding hair in hands
building stones forever
holding hair in hands

teeth on the floor w the blood like panting bad
it never dries our pool so deep
looking through the door lying  still holding 
dreams of world dreams of pools so deep

from the back wall still paiting mouse
like it never dries 

<h1>wench</h1>
	
pig in the back seat
i dont want to kiss it
i dont want to drive
driving to joy
driving to feel
i dont want to kiss it
hair foggy window
laugh without a whisper
i want to drive

reincarnate me 
the rooms a meadow
where did everybody go 
i could dance til 2040 yeah
im in the zone 
the rooms is meadow  where did everybody go
im in love and the speakers getting go

the radio went off on its own 

dancing like we talk well together
dancing like we talk well together

just enough to talk to her
just until we do recall
just until we’re not with you
just an object to you

handle spaces in between 
touching your tshirt, moving
school of fishes in the sea
how am i still lonely 
dont wait for me,  i'm stalling 
stay awake til morning

talking like fake 
just to know we disagree
anyone stop this night and found it 
accident through the big sunlight
found it through
now we take this knife
will it set us free set us free

talking like 
never live never breath
look too gruesome talk too sad faking it 

tie the knot to stop the blood 
lay my vessel in the mud 
what i do is just enough
cause really whos counting 
the pain is everything is nothing 
the love is endlessly becoming

just enough to talk to her
just until we do recall
just until we’re not with you
just an object to you

dancing like we talk well together
dancing like we talk well together

if i cook some for a sadly 
until we think of
this time i cant intrest you
wake up to the summer
this time it's coming
call you suffer time

look too gruesome talk too sadly
until we fake it.......
this time i cant intrest you
wake up to the summer
the sun is coming
thank you suffer time

<h1>pink donut</h1>

i saw a way
living it
two hours far

so hard to waste it
so hard to lay
still still

take ur hand to ur arms 
so softly 
when u feel small
draw someone smaller
not high
came to when i was falling
could have been an alter
could have been an alter

i have notes from old lovers 
that i hope you never find
you must know how 
hard it can be
to really really say goodbye
but you give me these notes now 
that are like worlds i can go to 
the grow into this whole garden 
and i dont know how u do
what u do

still still

that’s enough i resent it
so we did i hate it
now we fall so contagious
i stay up

don't be confused
we had
just to like you
we did
nothing before
just say never find you

i have old notes from old lovers 
that i hope you never find
u must know how 
hard it can be to really 
really say goodbye
but u give me these notes now 
that are like worlds i can go to 
that grow into this whole garden 
and idk how u do
what u do
